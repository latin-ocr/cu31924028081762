TRANsLA'rION.

To all who shall see or hear this writing, Juliana of Ponte, daughter
and heir of the late Adam of Ponte, burgess of Ayr, greeting in the Lord ε
Whereas the foresaid Adam, my father, not having consideration and dis-
cernment of my estate as his heir, by a eharitable impulse, and for the
welfare of his soul, and of the souls of his ancestors and successore, gave
and granted to God and the blessed Katherine the virgin, of Ayr, and to
friar John 20f Torry, then prior of the said house, and to the convent of the
same place, and their successors, his stone house in the Woodgate, with
the “ lead ’' and vessels and other utensils wholly belonging to the said
house, and three perches of land lying in the Gannibergate, together
with twenty—one shillings of sterlings of annualrent to be uplifted from
the barony of Alloway, Gortun and Gortluy: and whereas the foresaid prior,
considering my estate and need, has of his favour and good will, granted to
me, for the whole time of my life, the aforesaid stone house, with the “lead '’
and utensils above mentioned, and three perches before named, Therefore
I, in my lawful widowhood, have given and granted, and by this my present
writing, for me and my heirs for ever, confirmed to God and Saint Katherine,
and to the foresaid prior and convent, and their successors, the foresaid
twenty-one shillings of sterlings with the pertinente, to hold to them and
their successors, as freely and quietly, fully and honourably, as I or my
predecessors held the foresaid annualrent, at any time since our lord the
King Alexander gave and confirmed the said annualrent from his free ferme
of the barony of Alloway, to our predecessors, in excambion for land
yielding as much rent within the burgh of Ayr, which the said king gave to
these friars for enlarging their cemetery: Further, I have granted to the same
prior and convent, and their successors, that the said stone house, with three
perches above said, and with another perch formerly granted to me by my
said father as a marriage-portion, shall freely and quietly revert to them,
without any withholding or impediment of us or ours, if it shall happen me
to die, and when humanly there shall be an end of me, so that neither I nor
my heirs nor any one in our name, thenceforth‚ after my decease, shall make,
or take in hand to make, any claim to the foresaid annualrent, nor to the
said house and perches, under the penalty of one hundred shillings to be
paid to the fabric of the Church of Glasgow, and of another hundred shillings
