ABsrnAor.

Notarial copy of Brief by Pope Leo the Tenth, narrating that the
master general and provincial priors of the Friars Preachers, having repre-
sented to him that albeit Pope John XXII. by his constitution beginning
Vas electionis, condemned the erroneous opinion of the late John de
Polliaco, holding, among other errorS‚ that the faithful were bound to confess
again to their own priests the sins which they had confessed to the friars
of the Mendicant Order, according to the general licence granted by Pope
Clement V.‚ by his constitution published in the Council of Vienne,
beginning Duolum: and that afterwards Pope Eugenius IV.‚ Nicholas V.
and sixtus IV.‚ also condemned the foresaid and other opinions and asser-
tions of the said John de Polliaco and others, declaring they ought to be
proceeded against as suspected heretics from the Catholic faith ; and that the
said Pope Sixtus granted that if rectors of parish churches maliciously
refused or deferred to give the sacraments of the eucharist and of extreme
unction to those who confessed to the said friars, without any other
reasonable cause, the friars might then minister these sacraments to the
said persons when they made request to that effect ; and that the friars, or
their 'kindred who should wish to be buried at the churches of the Mendi-
cant Friars, should not be compelled‚ even under pretext of any custom
whatever, to carry the bodies of the dead to the parish churches or other
places, and with or without them, therein to celebrate, 01· cause to be
celebrated, divine service, before 01· after the burial of them, etc.; and
further narrating that the said Pope Leo X. in the last Lateran Oouncil
decreed that those who confessed to the Mendicant Friars in accordance
with the Clementine constitution be considered to have complied, as to con-
fession, with the constitution which begins Omnis utriusque sexus, and had
limited the foresaid concession as to the administration of the sacraments to
the case where they were refused without just cause, the fact of such refusal
being established by the evidence of neighbours, or of a notary public
thereto required; and further, that the said pope, by letters in form of brief,
declared that those who heard mass 111 the churches of the Mendicant Friars
on the Lord's day, and 011 other festival dayS, without despising their own
priest, did not incur any guilt or pain of mortal sim and lastly, by other
letters, also 111 form of brief, he approved and confirmed all and sundry
