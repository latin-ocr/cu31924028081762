INTRODUGTION. xxix

In 1614 the magistrates of Ayr resigned into the king's
hands the church lands and rents belonging to them, for the
purpose of getting a new infeftment in their favour.1 The
document contains apparently a complete list of the possessions
of the Friars Preachers which were then in the hands of the
municipality. Their later history will be afterwards traced in
the documents belonging to the burgh.

The records now printed enable us to give a few of the
Priors of the Convent of S. Katherine‚ though the list is,
especially in the earlier period, obviously imperfect. The first
of whom we have any mention is John de Torry, who appears
in an undated charter, apparently about the first half of the
fourteenth century.2 In 1401 Patrick of Garrick 3 appears as
prior, but when he was appointed or how long he continued is
uncertain 5 but it is probable his successor would be Robert of
Linlithgow, whose name and seal occur in charters of 1406.4
An interval of more than half a century occurs during which
no name is recorded. But in 1460 Patrick. Pulty⁵ is mentioned
as prior. His name occurs in 1469,6 in 1471,7 and in 1476.8
In 1488 John Reid was prior? and he is mentioned in 1491.1⁰
John Shanks occupied the place in 1500 1² and 1503.12 He was
succeeded by Hugh Ramsay, who is recorded in 150513 and
1508.14 J ames Young occurs in 1515,15 Robert Pratt in 152416
and 1527,17 John Litstare in 1541,18 and Andrew Leiche in 1557 .²⁹
