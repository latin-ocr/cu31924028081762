INTRODUOTION.

Ir is much to be regretted that so little is recorded
relating to the history of the Order of Preaching Friars in
Scotland. The original documents cannot be recovered, and
without them we have little except tradition to inform us.
According to the received account, the Preaching Friars
were brought into Scotland during the reign of Alexander
II. The continuator of Fordun, and the author of a chronicle
printed in the Extracta e Variis Oronicz's Scomb} give the year
1230 as the exact date of their first appearance. It is said
that Clement, afterwards Bishop of Dunblane, received the
habit at the hands of S. Dominio himself, and was the first of
the Order in this country. He is probably the same individua]
who is mentioned in the Acts of the Genera] Council heldat
London in 1230.2 He was elected and consecrated Bishop of
Dunblane in 1233,3 and died in 1256.4 Spotiswood, on the
other hand, says the Order was introduced into this country

by William Malvoisin, Bishop of S. Andrews.
