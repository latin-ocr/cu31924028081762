xxx INTRODUOTION.

Many of the documents have the seals attached to them, in
good preservation. Perhaps the most interesbing is an hitherto
unpub'lished. privy seal of John, Earl of Oarrick, the Steward
of Scoffland.1 Though unfortunatelyimperfect, enough remains
to give an idea of the design and workmanship. The seal of
Malcolm Fleming, Earl of Wigton,2 is a very fine example
of fourteenth century work, in excellent preservalzion. Only
one seal of the convent remainS, that of Robert of Linlithgow,
in 1406,3 but it is a beautiful specimen, in 'che fines‘c state.
The seal of the burgh of Ayr occurs in 1340 34 and the seals of
the merchants and burgesses are of special interest, being of
very rare occurrence.
