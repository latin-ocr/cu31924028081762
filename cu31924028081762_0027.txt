Alexander the II. founded eight 11011666 of the Order,
namely at Edinburgh, Berwick, Ayr, Perth, Aberdeen, Elgin,
Stirling, and Inverness. Considerable uncertainty exists as
to the exact date of the earliest foundation. That honour has
been claimed for Ayr‚ on the authority of S. Antonine, and it
is not improbable that it may have been the case. Spotiswood
gives the same year for the foundation of Ayr, Edinburgh,
and Berwick, viz. 1230. He is responsible for the statement
that the convent of S. Katherine at Ayr was founded by
William, Bishop of S. Andrews, though he also gives the
more correct account by the author in the Ewtracta e Variis
Cronicis Scocz‘e, which is rendered certain by 1116 16001116 now
