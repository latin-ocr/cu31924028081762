xxviii INTRODUOTION.

The Prior and Convent granted a tenement in Ayr in 1515
to Roland Kennedy:1 and in the same year received a grant
from Friar John Walker, and in 1518 another from Friar
Andrew Lathis.2 Adam Wallace of N ewton, alderman of Ayr,
gave in 1524 his walkmill and pertinents to the convent:3
and this is the last recorded donation to the Friars
Preachers. They received possession in 1541 of the tenement
Η Which had been granted to Alan Boyman‚ according to the
“altogether laudable custom of the burgh of Ayr, beyond the
memory of man,” by proving in their head courts of the burgh
that the annualrent had not been paid.4 In 1557 the convent
made over to John Blair of Middle Auchindrane, and Helen
Cathcart his wife, a property in the principal street of the
burgh of Ayr, for the annual payment of six merks.⁵ ,

Immediately after the Reformation, Queen Mary granted
to Charles Oraufurd, one of her gentlemen servitors, the lands,
houses, mills, fishings, and other possessions which had be-
longed to the Friars Preachers of Ayr,⁶ for the space of nine-
teen years. In 1567 the provost‚ bailies, and community of
Ayr, received a gift under the Privy Seal, of the lands, posses-
sions, and revenues of the Dominican and Minorite Friars of
Ayr, to be called in all time coming the Foundation of the
Ministry and Hospital of the Burgh of Ayr;⁷ for an honest
provision for the ministers of the Word of God, and the
support of an Hospital for poor, mutilated and distressed
persons, orphans, and infants deserted by their parents.
